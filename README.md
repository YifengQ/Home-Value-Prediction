# Home-Value-Prediction
Using an RNN or LSTM we plan to predict the value of homes sold in 2017 and if successful beyond. We plan to use the Kaggle dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data) and separate the data from 2016 and 2017 into train/test datasets. Data cleaning and implementation will be decided experimentally. For network architecture, we will attempt to encode home attributes (most likely one hot encoded) into a vector and group similar homes as price sequences. The similarity will be determined simply by counties at first. If time permits we may attempt to determine similarity by location, as well as homes with the same or corresponding vectors of attributes. The date sold would determine the order of the sequence and partitioning would be done based on network size constraints. The home price would then be predicted using the inference of a new attribute vector. We would then test the accuracy of our algorithm using the Mean Absolute Error between the log of the original sale price and the log of our estimate.
